# MoviesOMDBAPIApp

A very basic API Call project, that uses OMDB API to retrieve Movie and series data from entering it's title.
You need a working OMDB API Key that you can get here https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx for free.

There is a prompt to enter it in every refresh, for testing purposes, but you can hardcode it in script js file.

The UI was created for a IcodeThis Challenge, and i used it as a reference for this project


ToDo List
-Responsive Design
-Autocomplete
-Recreate it with VUE.js
